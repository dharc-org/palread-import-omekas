Topic	Tips							Examples
ENTER VALUES	When there is a down arrow in the field, start typing your value and the autocompletion will show you  what values are allowed							
PEOPLE NAME	Always use across tables the following  normalised forms of names:  @english   Lastname, Middlename Firstname OR   Lastname, Firstname			@arabic (if this is available,  please use this form of name across tables)    Lastname, Granfathername Fathername Firstname OR     Lastname, Fathername Firstname OR     Lastname, Firstname				Daquino, Marilena Daquino, Lucia Marilena
OMONYMS	In case of omonyms, please include also dates in parentheses and use this form across tables							Daquino, Marilena (1986-)
PLACE NAME	Only for Palestine historical or small cities,  please fill also the column "District". For other countries is not necessary							Gaza , Gaza, Palestine
EMPTY VALUES	If there is no value for some cell, leave the cell empty. Avoid to use "x", "N/A", etc.							
MULTIPLE VALUES	Avoid the vertical filling. For those columns where there is no data validation  (i.e. you don't see the down arrow) it means that multiple values are allowed.  Here you must insert multiple values in the same cell by using the semicolon separator (;)							In table "People", column "Sibling" Daquino, Marco ; Daquino, Miriam
EXPAND VALUES	Avoid the usage of acronyms, always expand names							Palestine Liberation Organisation (and not PLO)
ADD A NEW VOCABULARY TERM	If the value you input is not currently in the vocabulary,  first add it in the corresponding column in table Vocabularies, and then type it in the cell							
DOUBLE-CHECK A  NEW VOCABULARY TERM	If you are not sure that the new term you added to the vocabulary is a standard form of that name, please double-check on https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page . Use the text search (top-right menu) and look whether records for that name exist.							
SEARCH	To search a name in a table (not across tables though)  press CTRL+F and type the word to search in the top-right mask							
COPY&PASTE	To avoid typos when writing a name that is already in a table, please copy & paste it.  Select the text to copy, press CTRL+C (copies the selected text),  and paste it where needed by pressing CTRL+V
